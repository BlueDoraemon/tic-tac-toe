TO DO


8. Optional - If you’re feeling ambitious create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
Start by just getting the computer to make a random legal move.
Once you’ve gotten that, work on making the computer smart. It is possible to create an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm (read about it here, some googling will help you out with this one)

9. Add header and footer optimise for mobile devices


Learning Outcomes
